I am a physics student in the Glynn Family Honors Program at Notre 
Dame. I am excited to learn new skills and I'm particularly interested 
in quantum computing and mathematical physics. I'm interested in 
software engineering, data science or research internships this summer 
and I have experience as a software engineer intern at Lockheed Martin.
